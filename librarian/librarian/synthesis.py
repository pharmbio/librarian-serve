"""SynthesisAgent — turns ranked evidence passages into a cited answer.

One step: ``run(query, passages)`` writes a grounded answer and returns it.

Retrieval is the caller's job. The passages are what
:class:`~librarian.agent.LibrarianAgent`'s ``run`` returns — either live, or
round-tripped through a run's ``04_evidence.json``, which is those same records
serialized.
