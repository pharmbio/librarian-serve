"""Librarian agent runtime configuration.

Loaded once via ``load_runtime_config()`` and passed explicitly to
``LibrarianAgent(runtime_config=...)`` — the constructor has no implicit
default, so every caller decides its own config.

Values live in ``config.toml`` (this directory), which is self-contained:
every knob must be set there, there is no fallback.

There is no env-var override mechanism: a one-off change (e.g. an ablation
sweep varying ``num_subqueries``) is a plain ``dataclasses.replace()`` on the
loaded config, done explicitly by the caller:

    cfg = replace(load_runtime_config(), num_subqueries=3)
    LibrarianAgent(runtime_config=cfg, ...)
